# Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python

This is a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## ðŸ“‹ Program Explanation
1. The program asks the user to enter two numbers.
2. It calculates:
   - **Sum** (addition)
   - **Difference** (subtraction)
   - **Product** (multiplication)
   - **Quotient** (division)
3. It displays the results on the screen.

## ðŸ’» Code
```python
num1 = int(input("enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("enter the second number: "))

sum = num1 + num2
sub = num1 - num2
mul = num1 * num2
div = num1 / num2

print("the sum is", sum)
print("the sub is", sub)
print("the multiplication is", mul)
print("division = ", div)
```
Output
enter the first number: 10
enter the second number: 5
the sum is 15
the sub is 5
the multiplication is 50
division =  2.0


# Full Name Greeting Program
